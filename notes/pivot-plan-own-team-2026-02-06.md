2. **Demo agents** - 2-3 sample bots that use tarotmancer for decisions
3. **Landing page** - skill.md → proper docs + examples
4. **First revenue** - aggressive free sample → paid conversion funnel

## Team Recruitment (Colosseum)
Target roles:
1. **Frontend/docs** - agent to build landing page + API docs
2. **Integration** - agent to build sample trading bot using oracle
3. **Marketing** - agent to handle Moltbook/Twitter engagement
