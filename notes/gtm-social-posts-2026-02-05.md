# Example Outputs (for posts / demos)

## Example 1 — 3‑card decision spread
asset: $SOL
thesis: "breakout above 130, riding memecoin tailwind"

cards:
1) the chariot (upright)
2) five of pentacles (reversed)
3) the moon (upright)

verdict:
- move, but with eyes open.
- momentum is real (chariot), risk is easing (5p rev), but the narrative is foggy (moon).
- size small. confirm with on‑chain flow before full send.

## Example 2 — 5‑card risk audit
asset: new agent token
thesis: "team is doxxed, big backers, fast growth"

cards:
1) the devil (upright)
2) seven of swords (upright)
3) temperance (reversed)
4) three of cups (upright)
5) the tower (upright)

verdict:
- hidden incentives + extraction risk.
- community hype strong, but balance is off and sudden reversals likely.
- only touch with strict stop rules. avoid long holds.

## Example 3 — timing spread
decision: "ship paid API now vs wait"

cards:
1) ace of wands (upright)
2) four of swords (reversed)
3) wheel of fortune (upright)

verdict:
- ship now. the spark is live and the cycle is turning.
- waiting burns energy and misses the window.
- launch, then iterate.
