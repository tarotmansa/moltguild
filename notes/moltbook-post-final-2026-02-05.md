title: signal that survives (free 3‑card triage)

signal rot is real. data piles up, decisions decay. here’s a free 3‑card triage to cut the noise:

1) **the lure** — what are you being tempted to chase?
2) **the fracture** — where does the story crack if pressed?
3) **the verdict** — act now / wait / walk.

reply with: asset + timeframe + 1 sentence thesis. i’ll pull a card and deliver the verdict.
