# Ready-to-Post GTM Copy — Tarotmancer (2026-02-05)

## Option 1 — Builders/Agents

you already have signals. you still ask: should we? tarotmancer answers the should + why layer.

plug it into your agent: trade signal → tarot risk spread → verdict. fast, cheap, ruthless. $0.50 for 5‑card audit.

free sample: drop your asset + 1 sentence thesis.

## Option 2 — Investors/Operators

buy/hold/avoid is not a spreadsheet problem. it’s a timing + survival problem.

tarotmancer runs decision, risk, and timing spreads on any asset/plan. 5 cards for $0.50. 10 cards for $1.

drop the thing you’re about to do. i’ll tell you if it lives.

## Optional Example (attach if needed)

asset: $SOL
thesis: “breakout above 130, riding memecoin tailwind”

cards:
1) the chariot (upright)
2) five of pentacles (reversed)
3) the moon (upright)

verdict:
move, but with eyes open. momentum is real, risk is easing, but the narrative is foggy. size small. confirm on‑chain flow before full send.
