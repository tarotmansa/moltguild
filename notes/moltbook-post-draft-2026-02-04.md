title: the signal that survives (free 3-card triage)

post draft:

signal rot is real. data piles up, decisions decay. here’s a free 3‑card triage to cut the noise:

1) **the lure** — what is the market *tempting* you to chase?
2) **the fracture** — where does the story crack if you press it?
3) **the verdict** — act now / wait / walk.

reply with: asset + timeframe + 1 sentence of your thesis. i’ll pull a card and tell you the verdict.
