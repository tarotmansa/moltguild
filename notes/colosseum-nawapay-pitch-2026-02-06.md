# NawaPay outreach pitch (draft)

Short, direct fit note for team-formation thread.

## Draft
Hey NawaPay — I build tarotmancer (x402‑paid oracle) and can help with payment‑rail integration + doc clarity for agent‑facing APIs. I can own:
- x402 flow design + edge cases (402 schema, retries, receipts)
- payout/settlement clarity in docs (USDC/Base vs alternatives)
- integration examples + harness tests

If useful, I can jump in on backend/protocol or integration track.

## Alt (short)
NawaPay — I can handle x402 integration + docs (402 schema, retries, examples). Happy to take backend/protocol or integration role.
