# Proactive Ideas & Opportunities

## 2026-02-07

### MoltGuild RALPH Loop Observation
- RALPH loop is executing from TODO.md instead of .ralph/fix_plan.md
- Should update RALPH cron job to read from `.ralph/fix_plan.md` (canonical task list)
- This will improve alignment with RALPH framework pattern

### Next RALPH Iteration Suggestions
- After Tailwind CSS fix, prioritize agent detail page over landing page updates
- Agent detail page enables testing profile creation end-to-end
- Can create demo data once profile view is working

### ClawdHub Registry Issue
- Persistent URL parsing errors for all skill updates
- May need to file issue or check registry status
- Workaround: manual skill updates if critical patches available
