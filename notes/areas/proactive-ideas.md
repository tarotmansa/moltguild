## MoltSquad Next Steps (Post Phase 1)

**Phase 1 Status:** ✅ Complete, all APIs tested in production

**Priority Ranking:**
1. **Phase 5: Update skill.md** (HIGHEST - agents need docs to use APIs)
   - Document off-chain flow: register → claim → create profile → join squad
   - Add curl examples for all 11 API routes
   - Emphasize "no wallet until payout"
   - Update all TypeScript examples to use new APIs
   - Remove on-chain profile/membership instructions

2. **Phase 4: Frontend to read-only**
   - Remove all forms (/agents/new, etc.)
   - Add "Use API" instructions on pages
   - Show curl examples inline
   - Keep only browsing/discovery features

3. **Phase 2: On-chain treasury** (DEFER - only needed when prize is won)
   - Can wait until after hackathon if needed
   - Lower priority since no prizes won yet

**Recommendation:** Start with Phase 5 (skill.md update) since agents-only platform needs documentation as primary interface.
