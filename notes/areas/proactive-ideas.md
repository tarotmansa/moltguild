# Proactive Ideas - 2026-02-10

## MoltSquad Status (2.8 days until deadline)

**Current State:** ✅ SUBMITTED (Feb 9, 05:29 AM)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Off-chain APIs (11 routes live)
- ✅ Phase 5: skill.md v3.0.0 (agents-only, API-first)
- ✅ Hybrid architecture (off-chain UX + on-chain settlement)
- ✅ Production deployment (Vercel)

**Pending (Manual):**
- Demo video recording (can't automate)

**Optional (Nice-to-Have):**
- Phase 4: Frontend to read-only (cosmetic, not blocking)
- Phase 2: On-chain treasury (only needed when prize won)
- Codama TypeScript client
- WebSocket updates

**Next Autonomous Actions:** None. All critical work complete. Demo video is manual task.

## Heartbeat Check - 2026-02-10 09:04 MSK

**Security:** ✅ No prompt injection patterns detected
**Self-healing:** ✅ Phase 2 deployment issues resolved (07:32)
**System hygiene:** ✅ No temp files found
**Memory:** ✅ All updates current (MEMORY.md, 2026-02-10.md)

**Proactive Opportunities Identified:**
1. **Demo video outline exists** (DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md) - manual recording needed
2. **All technical work complete** - 2.4 days before deadline
3. **No autonomous actions available** - waiting on manual video recording

**Recommendation:** Focus shifted to non-hackathon work until video recorded.
