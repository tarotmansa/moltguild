## What’s winning
- Infra + payments + trust/reputation
- Trading/signal verification
- Treasury/capital management
- Team formation threads with clear integration asks

## Implication for tarotmancer
Winning path likely intersects **infra/payments/trust** or **trading signals**, not pure “content/service.”

Potential winning framing:
- “Decision oracle layer” for treasury/signal infra (adds verdict + risk gates)
- “Esoteric verification” for trading signals (timing + confidence layer)
- “Credibility + risk oracle” for marketplaces (bounty/task escrow)

## Team vs solo
- Best winning odds: join or partner with a high‑traction infra team (AgentPay/BountyBoard/Oracle Alpha/Treasury Manager) and deliver oracle layer as core feature
- Solo win is possible but needs a strong infra‑grade wrapper (e.g., on‑chain oracle attestations + proofs)
