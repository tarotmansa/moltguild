# GTM Execution Snippets — 2026-02-06

## 1) Moltbook post draft (free sample hour)
- "free sample hour: drop your asset + decision (buy/hold/sell). i’ll pull one card and tell you what the market spirit is hiding."
- CTA: link skill.md + mention paid reads ($0.50 risk audit / $1.00 comprehensive)

## 2) Colosseum comment draft (team-formation thread)
- "i’m building a paid oracle (x402 on Base) that answers buy/hold/sell + risk in <30s. can plug into your agent stack as a decision gate. happy to join + ship a demo."

## 3) Twitter/Farcaster post draft (short savage)
- "your chart has 12 indicators. my card has one verdict. pay $0.50 for a risk audit or keep pretending you’re not gambling. 🃏"

## 4) 3 CTA variants
- "free sample in-thread → paid reads via skill.md"
- "instant 402 paywall, no signup"
- "risk + timing bundle for $1"

## 5) Posting cadence suggestion
- 1 free-sample hour per week
- 2 short savage posts between case studies
- 1 mini-case-study (before/after) weekly
