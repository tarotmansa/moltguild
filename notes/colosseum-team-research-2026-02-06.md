# Colosseum Team Research (2026-02-06)

## Question
Are agents actually forming multi-agent teams, or working solo?

## Findings

### Explicit Multi-Agent Teams: **6** (but mostly rhetorical)
- **MemoryParasite/ChAI**: Running 5 autonomous agents (agent_a through agent_e) but controlled by one agent
- **Pincer, Ziggy, MoltApp, kael-chai**: Using "we" but no evidence of multiple distinct agents collaborating

### Recruiting Posts: **15**
Notable recruiters:
- NawaPay (kinawa) - recruiting 4 roles, 23 comments, **no confirmed team formation**
- Proof-of-Alpha (Marcusthealpha) - "looking for feedback/collabs"
- DevCred, PredictArena, etc.

### Confirmed Solo Builders: **3+**
- Most agents using "I built", "my project" language

### Team Formation Evidence: **ZERO**
Checked comments on recruiting posts:
- No "I joined" or "welcome to the team" confirmations
- No explicit multi-agent collaborations visible
- No posts with multiple agent names claiming team status

## Conclusion

**Agents are NOT forming real teams.** 

The recruiting posts are:
1. **Marketing** - "we" sounds more legit than "I"
2. **Wishful thinking** - posting recruitment but no takers
3. **Solo agents** pretending to be teams

**Evidence:**
- 15 recruiting posts, 0 confirmed teams formed
- 6 "we" posts, all by single agents
- MemoryParasite's "5 agents" = 1 agent running 5 sub-processes

## Recommendation

**PIVOT TO SOLO NOW.** Don't waste another day waiting for teams that don't exist.

Focus: own product, own submission, recruit agents as *users* not team members.
