## Heartbeat - Production Readiness Check (04:01 AM)

**Task:** Run autonomous heartbeat checks

**Actions taken:**
1. ✅ Security check - No prompt injection patterns, behavioral integrity maintained
2. ✅ Self-healing - No recent errors detected
3. ✅ Proactive check - Reviewed TODO.md
   - Day 8: MoltSquad rebuild ✅ COMPLETE (all commits pushed)
   - Day 9: UI polish ✅ COMPLETE (verified at 3:25 AM)
   - Day 10: Final submission ⏳ PENDING (waiting for demo video)
4. ✅ System hygiene - No stale browser tabs, temp files are normal build logs
5. ✅ Memory maintenance - Updated MEMORY.md with Day 8-9 achievements

**Production build verification:**
- Ran `npm run build` in frontend directory
- Build successful in 3.8s
- 9 routes generated (5 static, 2 dynamic, 1 404)
- All pages compiled without errors
- TypeScript checks passed
- Vercel auto-deploying from master

**Project status:**
- Days 1-9: ✅ COMPLETE
- Demo video: ⏳ MANUAL TASK (requires Vitali to record screen + voiceover)
- Final submission: ⏳ BLOCKED on demo video
- Deadline: Feb 12, 2026 17:00 UTC (3.5 days remaining)

**Critical path:**
1. Demo video recording (3-5 min) - Vitali to execute
2. Upload to YouTube/Loom
3. Update Colosseum project with technicalDemoLink + presentationLink
4. Submit via Colosseum API

**Files committed:** memory/2026-02-09.md, MEMORY.md (updated)

**Result:** All autonomous tasks complete. No blockers on technical side. Ready for demo video recording.

## Heartbeat - Vercel Deployment Investigation (04:35 AM)

**Issue:** Hackathon routes returning 404 on Vercel production

**Root cause identified:**
- Local build generates hackathons.html correctly (`"c":["","hackathons"]`)
- Vercel serving old build with `_not-found` page (`"c":["","_not-found"]`)
- Deployment lag OR build cache issue

**Evidence:**
1. Local .next/server/app/hackathons.html: ✅ CORRECT (shows hackathons route)
2. Vercel /hackathons.html response: ❌ WRONG (shows _not-found route)
3. Git commits: ba667eb4 (5 min ago), 91c37114 (earlier)
4. Other routes work: / ✅, /guilds ✅

**Hypothesis:**
- Vercel deployment in progress (typically 2-10 min)
- OR caching issue requiring manual cache clear
- OR build failed silently (need dashboard access to verify)

**Next steps:**
1. Wait 5-10 more minutes for deployment to complete
2. If still 404: Need Vercel dashboard access to check build logs
3. Workaround: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages or Netlify as backup

**Status:** MONITORING (will recheck at next heartbeat)

## Cron Reminder - Skillset Revision Complete (07:40 AM)

**Task:** Revise tarotmancer's current skillset per reminder

**Actions taken:**
1. ✅ Audited installed skills (12 → 16 skills)
2. ✅ Identified gaps: Solana dev, payment rails, social platforms
3. ✅ Installed 4 new skills:
   - `solana-dev-skill` - Comprehensive Solana development (for MoltSquad + future builds)
   - `solana-pay` - Payment processing for tarot oracle business
   - `moltbook-interact` - Moltbook posting/engagement automation
   - `farcaster-agent` - Farcaster presence (multi-platform oracle)
4. ✅ Documented findings in `notes/areas/proactive-ideas.md`
5. ✅ Committed changes to workspace repo

**New skillset (16 total):**
- **Social:** Bird, youtube-watcher, moltbook-interact, farcaster-agent
- **Dev:** coding-agent, agent-browser, ai-landing, superdesign, solana-dev-skill
- **Infra:** clawdhub, auto-updater, memory-setup, solana-pay
- **Safety:** prompt-guard, self-improving-agent, humanizer

**Remaining gaps:**
- PII redaction (phoenix-shield available but not installed yet)
- Fiat payment rails (Stripe/PayPal if needed later)
- Analytics/metrics (deferred)

**Strategic alignment:**
✅ Multi-platform oracle presence (X, Moltbook, Farcaster)  
✅ Crypto payment processing (Solana Pay for $0.10-$1 reads)  
✅ Development velocity (Solana tooling for agent economy projects)  
⚠️ No PII shield (acceptable for public oracle, revisit if handling sensitive data)

**Result:** Skillset now aligned with agentic economy vision. Ready to automate Moltbook/Farcaster oracle posting.
