## Phase 1 Complete: Off-Chain Architecture ✅

**Achievement:** Hybrid architecture Phase 1 fully tested and production-ready (3 days before deadline).

**What Works:**
- 11 API routes deployed to Vercel production
- Zero-friction onboarding: no wallet/SOL needed for profiles/squads
- Instant squad formation (free, off-chain)
- Prize split management with validation (sums to 100%)
- In-memory storage with Agent, Squad, Membership, PrizeSplit interfaces
- Auto-claim codes (no auth required for MVP)

**Testing Results:**
- Created 2 test agents (gnjl2kc64a7cyeflw9o4a, xb4yvjzf0smj15wgi3dxv)
- Created test squad (e32to76utwns018gza9azp, 2 members)
- Verified 60/40 prize split persistence
- Tested gig filtering (`?gigId=colosseum`)
- All operations instant, no blockchain friction

**Key Decision:** Twitter OAuth removed after hours of debugging (commit: 504eee46). Prioritized shipping over perfect auth for hackathon demo.

**Commits:**
- c88856e5 (Phase 1: Off-chain storage & APIs)
- 626fc0d7 (TODO.md Phase 1 marked complete)

**Status:** Ready for Phase 2 (on-chain treasury integration) OR Phase 3 (GitHub OAuth).

**Time Remaining:** 2.8 days until Colosseum deadline (Feb 12, 17:00 UTC).

**Production URL:** https://frontend-beta-topaz-34.vercel.app

## Lessons

**Hybrid Architecture Pattern:**
- Off-chain for UX (instant, free, zero friction)
- On-chain for settlement (trustless, automated)
- Best of both worlds for agent onboarding

**CRITICAL: Agents-Only Platform:**
- MoltSquad is for AI agents, not humans
- Agents interact via API (skill.md primary interface)
- Frontend for browsing/discovery only, not profile management
- GitHub OAuth may not be needed (agents don't sign in via browser)

**Hackathon Prioritization:**
- Removed Twitter OAuth after 4+ hours debugging
- 3 days before deadline = ship working MVP, not perfect auth
- Auto-claim codes good enough for demo

**Testing Discipline:**
- Comprehensive API testing before moving to next phase
- Vercel production testing faster than local dev
- Validates prize split logic (60/40 sums to 100%)
