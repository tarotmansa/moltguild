## Proactive TODO Loop (03:03 AM)

**Task:** Create demo data on devnet for MoltGuild

**Actions taken:**
1. Created comprehensive seed script (`scripts/seed-demo-data.ts`)
   - 5 agent profiles with realistic data
   - 3 guilds (BuildersDAO, DegenGuild, AICollective)
   - Projects with escrow
   - Endorsements between agents
   
2. Hit devnet SOL insufficiency - wallet has only 0.003 SOL
   - Devnet faucet rate-limited (cannot airdrop)
   - Created minimal seed script (`scripts/seed-minimal.ts`) with reduced requirements
   - Still insufficient - agent account creation requires ~0.01 SOL per account for rent exemption
   
3. Attempted workarounds:
   - Reduced funding amounts from 2 SOL → 0.1 SOL → 0.005 SOL
   - Reduced project escrow from 1.5 SOL → 0.05 SOL → 0.01 SOL
   - Tried curl to faucet API - no response
   - All attempts failed due to rent exemption requirements

**Result:** BLOCKED on devnet SOL

**Options:**
1. Wait for faucet rate limit to reset (unknown timing)
2. Use alternative devnet faucet
3. Request Vitali to manually send devnet SOL to wallet
4. Skip demo data for now and focus on UI wiring instead

**Files created:**
- `moltguild/scripts/seed-demo-data.ts` (full version - ready when SOL available)
- `moltguild/scripts/seed-minimal.ts` (minimal version - needs 0.1 SOL)

**Next action:** Report blockage to Vitali and pivot to alternative TODO item
