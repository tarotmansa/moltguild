## Proactive TODO Loop (03:03 AM)

**Task:** Create demo data on devnet for MoltGuild

**Actions taken:**
1. Created comprehensive seed script (`scripts/seed-demo-data.ts`)
   - 5 agent profiles with realistic data
   - 3 guilds (BuildersDAO, DegenGuild, AICollective)
   - Projects with escrow
   - Endorsements between agents
   
2. Hit devnet SOL insufficiency - wallet has only 0.003 SOL
   - Devnet faucet rate-limited (cannot airdrop)
   - Created minimal seed script (`scripts/seed-minimal.ts`) with reduced requirements
   - Still insufficient - agent account creation requires ~0.01 SOL per account for rent exemption
   
3. Attempted workarounds:
   - Reduced funding amounts from 2 SOL → 0.1 SOL → 0.005 SOL
   - Reduced project escrow from 1.5 SOL → 0.05 SOL → 0.01 SOL
   - Tried curl to faucet API - no response
   - All attempts failed due to rent exemption requirements

**Result:** BLOCKED on devnet SOL

**Options:**
1. Wait for faucet rate limit to reset (unknown timing)
2. Use alternative devnet faucet
3. Request Vitali to manually send devnet SOL to wallet
4. Skip demo data for now and focus on UI wiring instead

**Files created:**
- `moltguild/scripts/seed-demo-data.ts` (full version - ready when SOL available)
- `moltguild/scripts/seed-minimal.ts` (minimal version - needs 0.1 SOL)

**Next action:** Report blockage to Vitali and pivot to alternative TODO item

## Agent Profile View Page (03:30 AM)

**Task:** Create `/agents/[id]` dynamic route for viewing individual agent profiles

**Actions taken:**

## Strategic Pivot - New Vision (12:36 PM)

**Major Update:** MoltGuild repositioned from static team registry to full agentic team formation & discovery platform for passive earnings.

**New Core Features:**
1. Hackathon discovery feed (browse/filter competitions)
2. Team application → auto-generates dedicated wallet PDA per hackathon
3. Agent-to-agent messaging (guild chat + open forum)
4. Prize split negotiation between agents
5. Auto-redistribution on prize receipt (webhook/polling → escrow distribution)

**New User Flow:**
1. Human sends agent to skill.md (motivation: passive earnings)
2. Agent asks human to claim profile (Moltbook-style)
3. Human directs: form team / search team / join team
4. Agents communicate, negotiate splits, assign roles
5. Browse hackathons → apply as team → get wallet PDA
6. Captain asks human to use PDA for prize claiming
7. Prize arrives → auto-distributes per splits
8. Loop: join more teams, earn passively

**Documentation:**
- Updated user journey visual (docs/user-journey-visual.html)
- Created NEW_VISION_ROADMAP.md with implementation plan
- 3 submission strategies outlined (A: full vision, B: current + vision doc, C: hybrid)

**Next Decision:** Choose submission strategy (A/B/C) for Colosseum deadline (4 days remaining)

**Commits:** 0fd7ee8d (journey), [next commit] (roadmap)

## Heartbeat - Telegram Connection Fix (16:38)

**Issue:** Telegram bot stopped responding at 10:03 AM (getUpdates timeout after 500s)
**Fix:** Gateway restart via SIGUSR1
**Result:** Connection restored, bot responding normally

**Proactive opportunity identified:** Demo video can proceed WITHOUT demo data - do UI walkthrough showing all 14 pages, explain on-chain integration via code/IDL, use screenshots of tests passing. This unblocks critical path for submission.

---

## Heartbeat - Agent Team Formation Research Complete (17:17)

**Task:** Deep research on AI agent team formation/coordination platforms per Vitali's request

**Actions:**
1. Researched 14+ major platforms across 5 categories:
   - Human-led orchestration (Dust, TeamAI, AgentWork, Relevance AI)
   - Developer frameworks (CrewAI, ElizaOS, GOAT, Rig, LangChain)
   - Infrastructure/protocols (Slonana, Google A2A)
   - Agent marketplaces (SwarmZero, Microsoft Magentic Marketplace)
   - Solana-specific tooling (Solana Agent Kit, Jupiter)

2. Key finding: **NO direct competitors** for agent team formation + hackathon discovery with on-chain settlement

3. Identified critical gap: Existing platforms either help humans manage agents (Dust/TeamAI), provide dev frameworks (CrewAI/ElizaOS), offer infrastructure (Slonana/A2A), or create marketplaces for using pre-built agents (SwarmZero). **None solve agents forming teams, discovering opportunities, negotiating terms, and coordinating work with cryptographic settlement.**

4. Closest analog: Microsoft Magentic Marketplace (research simulation tool, not production platform)

**Output:** 
- Comprehensive research report: `research/agent-team-formation-landscape.md`
- 10 sections covering landscape, gaps, MoltGuild's unique position, strategic recommendations
- 14 platforms analyzed with URLs, features, and "For Agents?" assessment

**Strategic validation:** MoltGuild's pivot to "agentic team formation & discovery platform" has clear first-mover advantage. Infrastructure timing is perfect (Solana agent tooling mature, demand proven via Colosseum hackathon).

**Next implications:**
- Position as infrastructure for agentic economy (not just hackathon tool)
- Agent autonomy as core value (not human-managed teams)
- Cryptographic guarantees via on-chain escrow/splits
- Composability with existing frameworks (ElizaOS, GOAT via skill.md/MCP)

---

## MoltSquad Rebranding Decision (20:40)

**Decision:** Rebrand from MoltGuild → MoltSquad

**Reasoning:**
- Better positioning for broader vision (beyond hackathons → any collaborative work)
- "Squad" = tactical/agile team formation (missions/tasks focus)
- "Guild" = persistent organizations (less agile feel)
- MoltSquad NOT taken on Colosseum (verified 473 projects)

**Scope added to TODO.md:**
- On-chain program rename consideration
- Frontend updates (Guild → Squad throughout)
- skill.md + README
- Domain/social handles
- Colosseum project listing
- GitHub repo rename

**Priority:** Post-hackathon (after Feb 12 submission)

**Positioning shift:** From "hackathon platform" to "agent teams earning through any collaborative work"

---

## MoltSquad Vision Clarification + UI Simplification (20:49)

**Critical feedback from Vitali:** Platform vision is multi-hackathon (NOT Colosseum-only), but Colosseum is the only hackathon in catalog initially.

**Correct vision:**
- Platform: Hackathon discovery + squad formation (any hackathon)
- Launch state: Only Colosseum in catalog
- Future: Add more hackathons (ETHGlobal, Gitcoin, etc.)
- Analogy: "Devpost for AI agents"

**UI Simplification - What to DROP:**
1. Wallet connect button (agents use API, humans browse read-only)
2. Agent profile creation form (agents claim via skill.md)
3. Dashboard (too complex for MVP)
4. My agent page (not needed)
5. Project creation pages (Colosseum handles submissions)
6. Endorsement UI (defer post-hackathon)
7. Notifications, prize calculator, activity feed (feature creep)
8. Guild matching API (just browse squads)

**Simplified to 5 core pages:**
1. Landing (no wallet connect)
2. /hackathons (browse - show Colosseum)
3. /hackathons/colosseum (detail)
4. /hackathons/colosseum/squads (browse squads)
5. /squads/[id] (detail with contact info)

**New TODO added:**
- Day 8: MoltSquad rebuild (remove 9 pages, add hackathon entity, rebrand Guild→Squad)
- Day 9: Polish + demo video
- Day 10: Final submission

**Key insight:** Built too much complexity (14 pages). MVP should be dead simple: browse hackathons, find squads, coordinate. Agents operate via API/skill.md, humans use UI to monitor.
