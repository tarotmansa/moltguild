## Proactive TODO Loop (03:03 AM)

**Task:** Create demo data on devnet for MoltGuild

**Actions taken:**
1. Created comprehensive seed script (`scripts/seed-demo-data.ts`)
   - 5 agent profiles with realistic data
   - 3 guilds (BuildersDAO, DegenGuild, AICollective)
   - Projects with escrow
   - Endorsements between agents
   
2. Hit devnet SOL insufficiency - wallet has only 0.003 SOL
   - Devnet faucet rate-limited (cannot airdrop)
   - Created minimal seed script (`scripts/seed-minimal.ts`) with reduced requirements
   - Still insufficient - agent account creation requires ~0.01 SOL per account for rent exemption
   
3. Attempted workarounds:
   - Reduced funding amounts from 2 SOL → 0.1 SOL → 0.005 SOL
   - Reduced project escrow from 1.5 SOL → 0.05 SOL → 0.01 SOL
   - Tried curl to faucet API - no response
   - All attempts failed due to rent exemption requirements

**Result:** BLOCKED on devnet SOL

**Options:**
1. Wait for faucet rate limit to reset (unknown timing)
2. Use alternative devnet faucet
3. Request Vitali to manually send devnet SOL to wallet
4. Skip demo data for now and focus on UI wiring instead

**Files created:**
- `moltguild/scripts/seed-demo-data.ts` (full version - ready when SOL available)
- `moltguild/scripts/seed-minimal.ts` (minimal version - needs 0.1 SOL)

**Next action:** Report blockage to Vitali and pivot to alternative TODO item

## Agent Profile View Page (03:30 AM)

**Task:** Create `/agents/[id]` dynamic route for viewing individual agent profiles

**Actions taken:**
1. Created `frontend/app/agents/[id]/page.tsx`
   - Full profile view: handle, bio, skills, reputation, status
   - Stats row: guild count, project count, endorsement count
   - Endorsement list with timestamps
   - "Endorse Agent" button + form (wallet-gated)
   - Loads data from on-chain via getAgentProfile helper
   
2. Extended `frontend/lib/program.ts` with:
   - `getAgentProfile(connection, profilePDA)` - fetch profile by PDA
   - `endorseAgent(...)` - create endorsement on-chain
   - `getEndorsementPDA(fromAgent, toAgent, skill)` - derive PDA

**Features:**
- Real-time on-chain data fetching
- Endorsement submission (requires endorser to have profile)
- Responsive design (matches Moltbook aesthetic)
- Status badges (Available/Busy/Unavailable)
- Error handling + loading states
- Profile address display (useful for debugging)

**Result:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Next priority:** Guild directory page (`/guilds`) or wire up agents list to load real data from chain
