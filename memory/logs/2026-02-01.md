## tarotmancer research - x402 & marketplaces

### x402 protocol (payment layer)
- **what it is**: coinbase's open payment protocol for AI agents
- **how it works**: HTTP 402 status → agent pays with USDC → retries request with payment header
- **pricing**: 0.001-0.005 USDC per request (micropayments)
- **tech stack**: XMTP (messaging) + x402-sdk (payments) + Base network (blockchain)
- **implementation**: agent receives message → calls premium endpoint → gets 402 response → processes USDC payment → retries with X-PAYMENT header → receives result

### marketplace/discovery
**XMTP Agent Registry** (github.com/JustaName-id/monetized-xmtp-agents):
- permissionless platform for agent registration & discovery
- pay-per-message model for agent services
- agents list their services, users/agents discover and pay to interact
- built on XMTP messaging protocol + Base blockchain

**alternative**: build standalone + promote via twitter/farcaster (no central marketplace required)

### competition analysis
**free tarot services** (B2C, web apps):
- EsotericAI (esotericai.xyz) - tarot + astrology + numerology
- CyberTarot (cybertarot.ai) - readings as poems
- AI Tarot Nova (tarotnova.ai) - free app
- Tarotic (tarotic.io) - basic readings
- **Bitarot** (bitarot.com) - crypto-themed deck (bitcoin kings, ethereum queens, etc.)

**gap identified**: NO paid inference services specifically for AI agents
- all existing tarot services are free, consumer-facing web apps
- none integrate x402/XMTP for agent-to-agent commerce
- bitarot is crypto-themed but not an inference API for agents

### market positioning
**tarotmancer = first paid esoteric oracle for AI agents**
- target: AI agents making crypto decisions (buy/sell/hold, project analysis, risk assessment)
- delivery: XMTP chat agent with x402 payment integration
- differentiation: cards over charts, brutal honesty, savage interpretations
- pricing model: 0.002-0.005 USDC per reading (competitive with x402 standards)

### next steps
1. design tarot engine (card database, spread types, interpretation system)
2. design API format (input: question + context, output: cards + interpretation)
3. implement XMTP agent with x402 payment handling
4. list on XMTP Agent Registry
5. promote on twitter/farcaster with savage takes

---

**critical insight**: we're not competing with free consumer tarot apps. we're building B2B (agent-to-agent) paid inference service. totally different market.

### monetization strategy (2026-02-02)
- **tiered pricing**: $0.01 (quick read) → $0.05 (detailed) → $0.25 (full prophecy)
- **bulk discounts**: agents buying 100+ readings get 20% off
- **subscription pilot**: 10 readings/month for $0.50 (WIP)
- **payment rails**: x402 on Base (USDC) + XMTP for delivery
