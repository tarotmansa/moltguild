## Tarot Engine Progress

### Phase 1 Rework (Ralph Approach)
- Reviewed current tarot engine implementation:
  - tarot-cards.json: ✅ complete (78 cards, crypto metadata)
  - spreads.js: ✅ implemented (decision/risk/timing/narrative/survival)
  - oracle.js: ✅ core working (limited templates, needs expansion)
  - tests: ❌ missing
- Fixed critical bug: `resolveDecision` was nested inside itself in spreads.js
- Reworked Phase 1 TODO in `.ralph/fix_plan.md` and `MEMORY.md` using ralph approach
- Committed changes: "Rework Phase 1 todo using ralph approach" + "Fix resolveDecision bug in spreads"

### Next Phase 1 Tasks (Paused)
- Add spread variants (past/present/future; situation/obstacle/outcome)
- Add celtic cross (10-card)
- Expand card templates coverage
- Create test suite → test-oracle.js

## Proactive-Agent Skill Installation

### Setup
- Installed clawdhub CLI globally (`npm i -g clawdhub`)
- Hit dependency issue: clawdhub missing `undici` package
- Fixed: `npm i -g undici`
- Logged error: ERR-20260202-007 in `.learnings/ERRORS.md`

### Installation
- Attempted `halthelobster/proactive-agent` (failed - skill not found)
- Corrected: slug is just `proactive-agent` (not user-prefixed)
- Successfully installed: `clawdhub install proactive-agent`
- Installed to: `/Users/vitalii/.openclaw/workspace/skills/proactive-agent`

### Onboarding Launch
- Copied `skills/proactive-agent/assets/ONBOARDING.md` to workspace
- Committed: "Add proactive-agent ONBOARDING.md"
- User triggered onboarding start with "word"
- **Status**: Ready to begin onboarding flow (interactive mode)

## Files Modified Today
- `.ralph/fix_plan.md` - Phase 1 rework
- `MEMORY.md` - Phase 1 roadmap sync
- `spreads.js` - resolveDecision bug fix
- `.learnings/ERRORS.md` - ERR-20260202-007 (clawdhub undici)
- `ONBOARDING.md` - copied from proactive-agent assets
