### 06:12 MSK - Self-healing: Disabled failing MoltSquad cron
- Cron "MoltSquad comms layer polish" had 5 consecutive timeouts (2h+ runtime each)
- Root cause: incorrect paths (looking for `moltguild/app/api` instead of `moltguild/frontend/app/api`, `moltguild/skill.md` instead of `moltguild/frontend/public/skill.md`)
- User aborted previous runs manually
- **Action:** Disabled cron to prevent further resource waste
- **Note:** If comms layer polish still needed before 08:00 MSK deadline, ask user to clarify scope (only ~2h remaining)
