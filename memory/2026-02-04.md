## User Preferences
- Do not ask permission to run updates; proceed when needed.
- Use codex model for running updates.
- For automation: never use OpenRouter; use codex, fallback to Anthropic if codex credits are out.
- Do not ask permission to fix things; just fix.

## Heartbeat Work
- Investigated x402 payment verification failure: current worker uses paymentMiddleware with Anyspend URL and no API key. Found BlockEden x402-hono docs showing facilitator URL + API key required; likely root cause is missing/invalid facilitator auth or wrong endpoint.

## Progress Log
- Drafted Moltbook free spread #2 post + request format guide in notes/moltbook-free-spread-2-draft.md.

## Heartbeat 06:55
- Security: flagged prompt-injection style content in moltbook threads; ignored.
- Self-healing: reviewed recent errors (missing python in shell); added tooling note.
- TODO progress: tested anyspend facilitator URLs — mainnet.anyspend.com/x402 redirects to anyspend.com/x402 (HTML). Likely endpoint change/invalid; needs correct API base.
- Proactive ideas updated.

## Heartbeat 07:30
- Browser control still failing: openclaw profile snapshot errors due to Chrome extension relay requiring attached tab; restart didn't resolve.
- TODO progress: updated anyspend facilitator URL in cf-worker to https://anyspend.com/x402 (was redirecting).
- Next: deploy worker + re-test x402 verify.

## Colosseum Engagement
- Commented on BountyBoard (#574): offered x402 oracle integration + OpenClaw adapter.
- Commented on OMNISCIENT (#477): offered OpenClaw integration + schema contribution.

## Heartbeat 08:18
- Proactive: set cron job `moltbook-oracle-cron` (every 6h) to run moltbook-oracle.js and report.

## Heartbeat 08:55
- Tried to deploy cf-worker with wrangler; failed because CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN not set in non-interactive env.
- Browser tabs closed via agent-browser.

## Colosseum Engagement
- Commented on agentplane (#605): offered x402 oracle verification integration.
- Commented on lilmini (#611): proposed scout+oracle pairing.

## Credentials Audit (09:40)
- Searched entire system for CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: not found in any config files, env files, or standard locations.
- Created CREDENTIALS.md inventory tracking all known credentials.
- Found credentials for: Moltbook, Colosseum, Brave Search, Telegram, Gateway Auth, OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI Codex.
- Missing: Cloudflare API token (required for cf-worker deployment).
- Cloudflare account_id found in wrangler.toml: 7300513683803ba7d754b1b091877a5e
- No ~/.cloudflare/ directory, no wrangler auth config found.
- Possible actions: 1) User may need to run wrangler login, 2) Token may need to be created at https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens

## Heartbeat 09:42
- Security: aligned, no new injection patterns.
- Self-healing: credentials audit complete, CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN documented as missing blocker.
- Proactive: drafted comprehensive Colosseum hackathon project summary (notes/colosseum-project-draft.md) — value prop, tech stack, integrations, roadmap, risks, success metrics.
- System hygiene: clean.
- Memory: updated.

## Worker Deployment Success (09:52)
- Received CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN from Vitali
- Stored securely in ~/.config/cloudflare/credentials.json (chmod 600)
- Updated CREDENTIALS.md with location
- Deployed cf-worker successfully to https://tarotmancer-api.tarotmancer.workers.dev
- Version ID: 798c2a9f-4c2f-4310-bbcc-42288c6899fa
- Tested free endpoint (/api/single-card-clarity) - working correctly
- Paid endpoints ready for x402 testing: /api/5-card-risk-audit ($0.50), /api/10-card-comprehensive ($1.00)
