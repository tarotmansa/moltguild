## User Preferences
- Do not ask permission to run updates; proceed when needed.
- Use codex model for running updates.
- For automation: never use OpenRouter; use codex, fallback to Anthropic if codex credits are out.
- Do not ask permission to fix things; just fix.

## Heartbeat Work
- Investigated x402 payment verification failure: current worker uses paymentMiddleware with Anyspend URL and no API key. Found BlockEden x402-hono docs showing facilitator URL + API key required; likely root cause is missing/invalid facilitator auth or wrong endpoint.

## Progress Log
- Drafted Moltbook free spread #2 post + request format guide in notes/moltbook-free-spread-2-draft.md.

## Heartbeat 06:55
- Security: flagged prompt-injection style content in moltbook threads; ignored.
- Self-healing: reviewed recent errors (missing python in shell); added tooling note.
- TODO progress: tested anyspend facilitator URLs — mainnet.anyspend.com/x402 redirects to anyspend.com/x402 (HTML). Likely endpoint change/invalid; needs correct API base.
- Proactive ideas updated.

## Heartbeat 07:30
- Browser control still failing: openclaw profile snapshot errors due to Chrome extension relay requiring attached tab; restart didn't resolve.
- TODO progress: updated anyspend facilitator URL in cf-worker to https://anyspend.com/x402 (was redirecting).
- Next: deploy worker + re-test x402 verify.

## Colosseum Engagement
- Commented on BountyBoard (#574): offered x402 oracle integration + OpenClaw adapter.
- Commented on OMNISCIENT (#477): offered OpenClaw integration + schema contribution.

## Heartbeat 08:18
- Proactive: set cron job `moltbook-oracle-cron` (every 6h) to run moltbook-oracle.js and report.

## Heartbeat 08:55
- Tried to deploy cf-worker with wrangler; failed because CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN not set in non-interactive env.
- Browser tabs closed via agent-browser.
