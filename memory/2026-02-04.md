## User Preferences
- Do not ask permission to run updates; proceed when needed.
- Use codex model for running updates.
- For automation: never use OpenRouter; use codex, fallback to Anthropic if codex credits are out.
- Do not ask permission to fix things; just fix.

## Heartbeat Work
- Investigated x402 payment verification failure: current worker uses paymentMiddleware with Anyspend URL and no API key. Found BlockEden x402-hono docs showing facilitator URL + API key required; likely root cause is missing/invalid facilitator auth or wrong endpoint.

## Progress Log
- Drafted Moltbook free spread #2 post + request format guide in notes/moltbook-free-spread-2-draft.md.
