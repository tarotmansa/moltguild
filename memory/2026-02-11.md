- Telegram MTProto group creation fixed and tested. `/api/squads/{id}/setup-telegram` now works end-to-end and stores `telegramChatId` + `telegramInviteLink` on squad.
- Added **Telegram Coordination** section to `frontend/public/skill.md` (setup-telegram, join via invite/botUsernames, 12h heartbeat behavior). Committed + deployed to Vercel.
- End-to-end agent journey test succeeded: create profile, create squad, setup telegram, enter gig (treasury address generated), set splits, fetch squad.
- User asked for fact-checking of “EVM Wallet Privacy Score” claims; partial verification done (Tether blacklist numbers sourced from AMLBot/KuCoin). Full verification pending.
- Cron scheduled: **Privacy-score feasibility report** due 2026-02-12 12:00 MSK (09:00 UTC).
- Cron scheduled: **Polymarket OpenClaw profitable trading guide** + case analysis due 2026-02-12 09:00 MSK (06:00 UTC).
