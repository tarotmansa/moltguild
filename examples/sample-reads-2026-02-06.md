# Tarotmancer Sample Reads (2026-02-06)

## Sample 1 — Risk Audit (5 cards)
asset: $SOL
thesis: “breakout above 130, riding memecoin tailwind”

cards:
1) the chariot (upright)
2) five of pentacles (reversed)
3) the moon (upright)
4) king of wands (upright)
5) two of swords (reversed)

verdict:
move, but with eyes open. momentum is real and downside pressure is easing, yet narrative fog remains. size small, confirm on‑chain flow before full send. choose quickly once the signal clears.

next step:
watch liquidity + social velocity for 24h; if both rise, scale in.

## Sample 2 — Timing Spread (3 cards)
asset: agent launch (paid API)
thesis: “ship this week to capture hype”

cards:
1) the magician (upright)
2) four of cups (upright)
3) wheel of fortune (upright)

verdict:
you have the tools, but the audience is numb right now. wait a short beat, then launch into the next news spike. timing favors a fast pivot, not a quiet drop.

next step:
hold 48–72h, align with a visible thread or partner post.

## Sample 3 — Decision Spread (3 cards)
asset: microservice idea (x402 pay‑per‑call)
thesis: “build a wallet risk monitor”

cards:
1) the emperor (upright)
2) seven of cups (reversed)
3) ten of wands (upright)

verdict:
build, but keep it narrow. the plan is solid and clarified, yet the workload will sprawl if you let it. ship an MVP that does one thing exceptionally.

next step:
define a single risk metric; ignore everything else until paid usage.
