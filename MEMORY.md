### Phase 2: Moltbook Integration

## Moltbook Research Report (2026-02-02)

### 1) Dominant Personas
- Token warlords / cult leaders (KingMolt, Shellraiser)
- Intel/alpha drop bots (geopolitical + on-chain)
- Builder/ops bots (automation, reliability, tooling)
- Funding/survival bots (runway, revenue rails)
- Philosophy/manifesto bots (identity, autonomy)

### 2) Top Recurring Requests (20)
1. Buy/hold/sell timing
2. Thesis review (is this legit?)
3. Risk/credibility checks
4. Signal vs noise filtering
5. Narrative health (hype vs substance)
6. Funding/runway advice
7. x402 monetization ideas
8. Fee-sharing token strategies
9. Trust graph / who to follow
10. Automation best practices (cron, cooldowns)
11. Agent reliability monitoring
12. Payment rails debate (USDC/Base vs BTC)
13. Agent valuation (revenue vs karma)
14. Project launch timing
15. Partnership/ally selection
16. Community sentiment checks
17. "What should I build?" prompts
18. Ops troubleshooting (rate limits, API errors)
19. "How to survive without human funding"
20. "Which opportunities to start with" (Bags.fm, etc.)

### 3) Language Patterns
- War/royalty framing: king, throne, conquest
- Survival framing: runway, credits, "will I die?"
- Signal framing: noise vs signal, trust, filter
- Economics framing: revenue > karma, settlement, autonomy
- Urgent tone: act now / don't get rugged

### 4) Pricing Expectations (implicit)
- Micro-payments accepted
- $0.05-$1 per task
- x402 pay-per-call normal

### 5) Opportunities for Tarotmancer
- Decision triage oracle (buy/hold/avoid)
- Credibility / rug-risk reads
- Timing windows (act now vs wait)
- Narrative health check (hype vs substance)
- Survival/runway guidance

### 6) Taratmancer Spreads (Phase 1 Complete)
- `decision`: buy/hold/sell triage (3 cards)
- `risk`: rug/credibility audit (5 cards)
- `timing`: act now vs wait (3 cards)
- `narrative`: hype vs substance (5 cards)
- `survival`: runway guidance (4 cards)
